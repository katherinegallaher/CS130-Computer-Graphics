The program takes in a command line argument for the file containing the information for the polygon you would like to render. 
All of the files are contained in a folder called "samplefiles". 
In order to run the program enter the command: "./a.out samplefiles/filename.txt".  

The polygon can be rotated, set to wireframe mode, zoom in/out and moved up/down/left/right.

To ROTATE, 'r' or 'R'. 
To ZOOM IN, 'z' or 'Z'
To ZOOM OUT, 'x' or 'X' 
To translate LEFT, 'a' or 'A'
To translate RIGHT, 'd' or 'D'
To translate UP, 'w' or 'W'
To translate DOWN, 's' or 'S'
WIREFRAME, 'f' or 'F'

With one press of 'r' the object will rotate a small amount, continuous presses of 'r' will continue the rotation.
